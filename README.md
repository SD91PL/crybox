# ðŸŽ® Crybox - Xbox Controller Support for Crysis and Crysis Warhead

## ðŸ“‹ Description

Crybox is a user-friendly modification designed to enhance Xbox controller support for the classic games Crysis (2007) and Crysis Warhead (2008) from GOG.com. It fixes the original games' limited and illogical button mappings, providing more intuitive controls for actions like nanosuit modes, vehicles, sprinting, and interactions. The mod includes optimized configuration files (actionmaps.xml, system.cfg, and diff_easy.cfg) that improve gameplay elements and offer two layout options: standard and alternative.

### Key Features

- Logical Xbox controller button remapping for better gameplay.
- Easy installation without editing files manually.
- Fully compatible with GOG versions; reversible and safe.
- Gameplay improvements through optimized configuration settings.
- Two controller layout options: standard and alternative.
